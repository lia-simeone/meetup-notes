## _Speaker:_

Lisa van Gelder, SVP Tech, Bauer Excel

## _Context:_

- Lisa was job searching late summer 2016
- She was frequently told she was unqualified by recruiters
- She is British and thought maybe the requirements for being a Tech Exec were different in the US (must have a CS degree or MBA)

## _Imagine two candidates_

Candidate | Degree | Coding experience | Management experience | Executive experience
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
A | Not CS | 5 months | None | None
B | Not CS | 15 years | 10 years | 1.5 years

Lisa is candidate B and she was interviewing for a Tech Exec job at the company where candidate A was CTO. He told her she was unqualified. Gasp!

## _Accidental A/B Test_

- Lisa discovered her friend Mike who is also a Tech Exec was interviewing at the same time for jobs in New York. Their career experiences are almost identical except Mike has a CS degree (and gender, of course).

- They both interviewed at three companies:

  Company | Lisa | Mike
  --- | --- | ---
  A (same as above) | She did not get the job and they said it was because she must have experience managing 75+ developers to be qualified. | No requirement came up for Mike. He had managed around 40 devs before. He was given an offer.
  B | Asked Lisa to solve a whole bunch of problems which she did well on. Did not get the job because they said she hadn't solved the exact problems they have. | Mike got asked entirely different questions from Lisa. He also did not have experience solving their exact problems, but they loved his answers.
  C | Lisa was told they were thrilled a woman applied as they wanted someone "with a softer touch." _eye roll_ | I can't remember what happened to Mike here

## _Executive recruiters_

_Worse than the interview process!_ (She used the phrase "dumpster fire," haha).

Three different recruiters told her she was wildly unqualified for a Tech Exec role and refused to work with her (remember she had been an Exec for ~1.5 years). After the third time, she refused to leave the recruiter alone until he told her _why_. He said it was because she had jumped from consultant directly to VP and it was title inflation.

_Guess what?_ Mike did the _exact_ same thing as Lisa. He worked as a developer for many years, then moved over to consulting for a few years, then got a job as Tech Exec. (In fact, it was Mike who inspired Lisa to get an Exec role since they have almost the exact same experience).

__No one has _ever_ talked to Mike about title inflation.__

## _It's 2017. Why is gender still an issue?_

Report by McKinsey on hiring bias:
- When recruiting someone from the 'in group' (someone like you), you hire based on potential
- When recruiting from the 'out group' (not like you), you hire based on experience
- This problem becomes drastic at the exec level because it's hard to practice being CTO if no one will hire you as a CTO (it's not like being a developer where you can learn on your own, you really have to do it to get experience)

## _The "pipeline problem"_

43.3% of the 150 top Silicon Valley companies have no women in _any_ Executive roles. Companies try to justify this massive gender gap by saying it's a pipeline problem.

Survey about CS graduates in North America vs. Facebook demographics:

- As the number of CS grads increases, the demographics of the top companies should change. But they don't. 
- Facebook happens to represent the distribution of all top Silicon Valley companies. 
- White grads get jobs on par with their proportions. Asian grads are over represented. Hispanic and black grads are hired at lower rates.

## Unconscious bias

There's a belief in tech that you have to have an X factor or some type of genius to be really good at writing code. And the belief is that white straight men have that talent more than other groups.

In fields where raw talent is held above all else, women and minorities are underrepresented. There was a study about police chiefs. One fake candidate was street wise and one was highly educated. They swapped the male and female names for two test groups. In both groups, the man was picked as the more qualified candidate.

Orchestras are another industry where innate talent is highly valued. They tried an experiment where they carpeted the floor (to soften high heels) and put up a screen during auditions to hide the identity of the person trying out. The number of women who got to the final round of interviews jumped to 50% from 5% (!!!).

Looking at GitHub, women's PRs are accepted less frequently when their username indciates it's a woman.

## _How to reduce bias as a hiring company_

1. Have a process (duh)
  1. 6 of 10 companies she interviewed did not have a set process for Execs and therefore were super susceptible to unconscious bias.
  2. Code challenges where the gender and ethnicity is anonymized are best. You could also do this with execs.
2. Have a diverse group of people _do_ the interviewing
3. Train recruiters on exactly what you're looking for
4. Recruit in batches 
  1. More of a problem at same companies
  2. At least 5 candidates that are diverse is a good rule of thumb.

## _How to protect yourself as a job seeker:_

1. Ask about the interview process and make sure it sounds regimented.
2. If you're being asked a lot about your experience, try to shift the conversation towards your potential. Ask them about their biggest challenges so you can shine in ways that aren't normally associated with women.
3. If you're rejected, ask for feedback.
4. If you meet someone during your interviews who you like but their company isn't a good fit, you should invite them out for coffee. She uses these contacts to build a peer network. Also, a lot of Exec positions are filled through word of mouth. These contacts can recommend companies who are a really good fit.
5. It's not you, it's them. Stay with it. Don't quit. Help make tech a better place. 

## _Audience questions:_

_Do you see any generational difference in your interviewers and their types of questions?_ No, she hasn't. 

_When you're more junior, how do you sort out legitimate feedback from sexist comments?_ Make sure you ask why. Tech doesn't have one thing that qualifies you. It's not like lawyers who take the bar exam or doctors who do a residency.

_I'm attending a coding bootcamp and they recommend put your picture up on GitHub etc. Should I make another GitHub where it doesn't have my female name and photo?_ No, please don't do that. If a company rejected you based on your gender, you don't want to work for them anyway.

_Do you have any tips for breaking unconscious bias in an onsite interview? Also, can you explain why you hate white boarding?_ They only evaluate coding skill through the take home. They do an in person pairing test but it evaluates communication and not coding skill. _Follow up: what about systems engineering?_ Lisa has only don't those sorts of interviews in person. 

_Would you recommend the coffee tip for lower level person?_ Yes, especially at smaller companies where you might be the most senior person. She does not pester. She sends one email. She starts with one informal coffee meeting where she comes prepared with a few questions. Then you can feel it out for whether they want to meet again.

_My company's CTO is a woman which is great. But she says she's been really lucky (which you also said) and that seems really common among female execs. Why do you think that is?_ There are a lot of bad experiences in Tech that are so egregious that  women leave the field entirely. It's a leaky pipeline, so there's definitely selection bias at play. She's not sure why she's been lucky. She wants to stop bad things happening to other women but she's not sure how to do that aside from getting more women into the industry.
